ABSTRACT

The Smart building energy management system project aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict energy consumption in a smart building. The dataset used is the energydata_complete.csv from UCI machine learning repository.The system will consist of various sensors installed in the building, such as smart meters, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, occupancy sensors, and lighting sensors, which will collect data at a frequency of one hour. The data will be logged in a CSV file and preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers.The project uses two machine learning algorithms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The project also includes an IoT system design to implement the energy management system in a smart building.

Keywords: Energy management, Machine Learning, CNN, LSTM .
